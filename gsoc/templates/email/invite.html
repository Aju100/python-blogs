Welcome to GSoC with the Python Software Foundation! <br />
<br />
All students are required to post weekly, there are 2 types of posts students will have to make, the first is the weekly check-in. For a weekly check-in every student will have to answer these 3 questions in a post; with each answer being <100 words.<br />
<br />
&emsp;1. What did you do this week?<br />
&emsp;2. What is coming up next?<br />
&emsp;3. Did you get stuck anywhere?<br />
<br />
The second post is a blog post, here a student will be required to go into some detial on what they are working on, what they struggle with, and what solutions they have come to. There is no formal structure to this and every student is welcome to use their own style but the above three questions should be answered in the blog post at some point. <br />
<br />
